<section id="Introduction">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>The Unicode Standard  [<a href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>] defines the
    universal character set. Its primary goal is to provide an unambiguous
    encoding of the content of plain text, ultimately covering all languages in
    the world, but also major text-based notational systems for science,
    technology, music, and scholarship.</p>
  <p>Currently in its <a href="#Unicode">sixth major version</a>, Unicode
    contains a large number of characters covering most of the currently used
    scripts in the world. It also contains additional characters for
    interoperability with older character encodings, and characters with
    control-like functions included primarily for reasons of providing
    unambiguous interpretation of plain text. Unicode provides specifications for
    use of all of these characters.</p>
  <p>For document and data interchange, the Internet and the World Wide Web
    make extensive use of marked-up text such as HTML
    and XML. In many instances, markup provides the same, or
    essentially similar features to those provided by format characters in the
    Unicode Standard for use in plain text. Another special character category
    provided by Unicode are compatibility characters. While there may be valid
    reasons to support these characters and their specifications in plain text,
    their use in marked-up text can conflict with the rules of the markup
    language. Formatting characters are discussed in Section 3, <a
href="#Suitable">Characters not Suitable for Use With Markup</a> and
    Section 4, <a href="#Format">Format Characters Suitable for Use With
    Markup</a>, compatibility characters in Section 5, <a
href="#Compatibility">Characters with Compatibility Mappings</a>.
    Section 6 briefly discusses noncharacters, and Section 7 is devoted to white
    space.</p>
  <p>The interaction of character
    encoding and methods of escaping characters in markup are discussed in the
    Character Model for the World Wide Web [<a href="#Charmod">Charmod</a>].</p>
  <p>The issues of using Unicode characters with marked-up text depend to some
    degree on the rules of the markup language in question and the set of
    elements it contains. In a narrow sense, this document concerns itself only
    with XML, and to some extent HTML. However, much of the general information
    presented here should be useful in a broader context, including some page
    layout languages.</p>
    <p class="note">Many of the recommendations of this
      report depend on the availability of particular markup or styling. Where
      possible, appropriate DTDs or Schemas should be used or designed to make
      such markup or styling available, or the DTDs or Schemas used should be
      appropriately extended. The current version of this document makes no
      specific recommendations for the design of DTDs or Schemas, or for the use
      of particular DTDs or Schemas, but the information presented here may be
      useful to designers of DTDs and Schemas, and to people selecting DTDs or
      Schemas for their applications. </p>
    <p class="note">The recommendations of this report do not apply in the case
      of XML used for blind data transport and similar cases.</p>

  <section id="Notation">
    <h3>Notation</h3>
    <p>This report uses XML [<a href="#xml10">XML</a>] as a prominent and general
      example of markup. The XML namespace notation [<a
href="#Namespace">Namespace</a>] is used to indicate that a certain element
      is taken from a specific markup language. As an example, the prefix 'xhtml:'
      indicates that this element is taken from [<a href="#XHTML">XHTML</a>]. This
      means that the examples containing the namespace prefix 'xhtml:' are assumed
      to include a namespace declaration of xmlns:xhtml="..." </p>
    <p>Characters are denoted using the notation used in the Unicode Standard,
      that is, an optional U+ followed by their hexadecimal number, using at least
      4 digits, such as "U+1234" or "U+10FFFD". In XML or HTML this could be
      expressed as "&amp;#x1234;" or "&amp;#x10FFFD;".</p>
  </section>
</section>


<section id="General">
  <h2>General Considerations</h2>
  <p>There are several general points to consider when looking at the
    interaction between character encoding and markup. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Linearity of text vs. hierarchy of markup structure</li>
    <li>Overlap of control codes and markup semantics</li>
    <li>Markup vs. Styling</li>
    <li>Coincidence of semantic markup and functions </li>
    <li>Extensibility of markup</li>
  </ul>
  
  <section id="Linearity">
    <h3>Linearity versus Structure</h3>
    <p>Encoding text as a sequence of characters without further
      information leads to a linear sequence, commonly called plain text. Character
      follows character, without any particular structure. Markup, on the other
      hand, defines a hierarchical structure for the text or data. In the case of
      XML and most other, similar markup languages, the markup defines a tree
      structure. While this tree structure is linearized for transmission in the
      XML document, once the document has been parsed, the tree is available
      directly.</p>
    <p>Operations that are easy to perform on trees are often
      difficult to perform on linear sequences and vice versa. By separating
      functionality between character encoding and markup appropriately, the
      architecture becomes simpler, more powerful and longer-lasting.</p>
    <p>In particular, operations on hierarchical structures can
      easily make sure that information is kept in context. Attributes assigned to
      parts of a document are moved together with the associated part of the
      document. Assigning an attribute to a part of a document limits the scope of
      the attribute to that part of the document. Performing the same operations on
      linear sequences of characters using control codes to set attributes and to
      delimit their scope requires much more work and is error prone. Locating the
      start or end of a span of text of the same attribute requires scanning
      backwards and forwards for the embedded delimiter or control code. Moving or
      editing text often results in mismatched control codes, so that an attribute
      might suddenly apply to text it was not intended for.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="Overlap">
    <h3>Overlap of Control Code and Markup Semantics</h3>
    <p>When markup is not available, plain text may require control
      characters. This is usually the case where plain text must contain some
      scoping or attribute information in order to be legible, i.e. to be
      able to transmit the same content between originator and receiver. Many of
      these control characters have direct equivalents in particular markup
      languages, since markup handles these concerns efficiently. If both
      characters and their markup equivalents may be present in the same text, the
      question of priority is raised. Therefore it is important to identify and
      resolve these ambiguities at the time markup is first applied.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="Markup">
    <h3>Markup and Styling</h3>
    <p>Besides the basic character encoding and text markup there is
      a third contributor to text functionality, namely styling. Markup is
      concerned with the logical structure of the text or data, e.g. to
      indicate sections, subsections, and headers in a document, or to indicate the
      various fields of an address record. Styling is used to present the
      information in various ways, e.g. in different fonts, different type
      styles (italic, bold), different colors, etc. Some character codes do
      not encode a generic character, but a styled character. Where these
      characters are used, styling information is frozen, i.e. it is no
      longer possible to alter the appearance of the text by applying style
      information. However, there are many examples where a historically free
      stylistic variation has over time become a semantic distinction that is
      properly encoded as plain text. Sometimes, what is a free variation in some
      contexts, implies strict semantic differentiation in others. In all such
      instances, altering the appearance of the text by styling information would
      irreparably alter the content of the text. This is of particular concern with
      mathematical notation or systems for phonetic and phonemic transcription
      which make extensive semantic use of styles on a character by character
      basis.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="Coincidence">
    <h3>Coincidence of Markup and Functions</h3>
    <p>Dealing with various functionalities on the markup level has
      the additional advantage that in most cases, text portions that need some
      particular attribute (or styling) are actually those text portions identified
      by markup. A paragraph may be in French, a citation may need a bidi
      embedding, a keyword may be in italics, a list number may be circled, and so
      on. This makes it very efficient to associate those attributes with
      markup.</p>
    <p>However, where local or point-like functionality is needed,
      markup is <em>not</em> very efficient and its main benefit, easy manipulation
      of scope, is not required. On the contrary, the intrusion of markup in the
      middle of words can make search or sort operations more difficult. For these
      cases expressing the information as character codes is not only a viable, but
      often the preferred alternative, which needs to be considered in the design
      of markup languages.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="Extensibility">
    <h3>Extensibility of Markup</h3>
    <p>Character encoding works with a range of integers used as
      character codes. This is extremely efficient, but has some limitations.
      Markup, on the other hand, is much more extensible. Using technologies such
      as XML Namespaces [<a href="#Namespace">Namespace</a>] and their application
      in schema languages like [<a href="#XMLSchema">XML Schema</a>], various
      vocabularies can be mixed.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="Suitability">
    <h3>Suitability of Characters in Markup</h3>
    <p>The suitability of a particular character for markup depends on its status
      in the Unicode Standard, the nature of its behavior in text and the
      availability of equivalent markup. Many format characters that are needed for
      advanced plain text are not suitable for use with markup. <a
href="#Suitable">Section 3</a> gives a list and detailed descriptions.
      However, not all format characters are unsuitable for use with markup. <a
href="#Format">Section 4</a> provides a list of format characters that are
      suitable for use with markup and gives some discussion about their use. In
      addition to format characters, the Unicode Standard also has compatibility
      characters, some of which may be replaceable by suitable markup. These
      characters are discussed in <a href="#Compatibility">Section 5</a>.</p>
  </section>
</section>


<section id="Suitable">
  <h2>Characters not Suitable for use With Markup</h2>
  <p>There are characters which are unsuitable in the context of markup in
    XML/HTML and whose use is discouraged, because one or more of the following
    conditions apply:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>They are deprecated in the Unicode Standard.</li>
    <li>They are unsupportable without additional data.</li>
    <li>They are difficult to handle because they are stateful.</li>
    <li>They are better handled by markup.</li>
    <li>They are undesirable because of conflict with equivalent markup.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><a href="#Charlist">Section 3.1</a> provides a list of such characters.
    Sections <a href="#Line">3.2</a> through <a href="#OtherDeprecated">3.10</a> discuss in more detail the following points for the discouraged
    characters.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Short description of semantics</li>
    <li>Reason for inclusion in Unicode</li>
    <li>Specific problems when used with markup</li>
    <li>Other areas where problems may occur (e.g. plain text)</li>
    <li>What kind of markup to use instead</li>
    <li>What to do if detected in a particular context</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Table of Characters not Suitable for use With Markup</h3>
    <p>The following table contains the characters currently considered not
      suitable for use with markup in XML or HTML. (See however the note in the <a href="#Introduction">Introduction</a>.) They

    <p>Except for Line and Paragraph Separator, or the Byte Order Mark, it is
      acceptable for browsers and similar user agents to ignore the presence of
      discouraged characters in HTML or XML. It is up to authoring tools to ensure
      proper conversion between these characters and equivalent markup where it
      exists.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="Line">
    <h3>Line and Paragraph Separator, U+2028..U+2029</h3>
    <p><em>Short description</em>: The line and paragraph separator provide
      unambiguous means to denote hard line breaks and paragraph delimiters in
      plain text.</p>
    <p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters were introduced into the
      Unicode Standard to overcome the ambiguous and widely divergent use of
      control codes for this purpose. See Section
      5.8, Newline Guidelines, in [<a href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
    <p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including these characters in
      markup text does not work where it would duplicate the existing markup
      commands for delimiting paragraphs and lines.</p>
    <p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The be can also
      problematic when used in plain text, because legacy data is usually converted
      code point for code point into Unicode and all receivers of Unicode plain
      text have to effectively be able to interpret the existing use of control
      codes for this purpose. As a result, fewer Unicode implementations support
      these characters, than would be the case otherwise.</p>
    <p><em>Replacement markup</em>: In HTML, use &lt;xhtml:br /&gt; instead of
      U+2028 and surround paragraphs by &lt;xhtml:p&gt; and &lt;/xhtml:p&gt;
      instead of separating them with U+2029.</p>
    <p><em>What to do if detected</em>: In a browser context, treat as white
      space, or ignore. When received in an editing context, replace the character
      by the corresponding markup. </p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="Bidi">
    <h3>Bidi Embedding Controls (LRE, RLE, LRO, RLO, PDF), U+202A..U+202E</h3>
    <p><em>Short description</em>: The bidi embedding controls are required to
      supplement the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm in plain text</p>
    <p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The Unicode Bidirectional algorithm
      unambiguously resolves the display direction for bidirectional text. It does
      so by assigning all characters directional categories and then resolving
      these in context. In a  number of circumstances this <em>implicit </em> method does not produce satisfactory results and embedding controls are
      needed to ensure that sender and receiver agree on the display direction for
      a given text. See Unicode Technical Report #9, The Bidirectional Algorithm <a
href="#UTR9">[UAX 9]</a>.</p>
    <p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters duplicate
      available markup, which is better suited to handle the stateful nature of
      their effect. </p>
    <p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The embedding controls introduce a
      state into the plain text, which must be maintained when editing or
      displaying the text. Processes that are modifying the text without being
      aware of this state may inadvertently affect the rendering of large portions
      of the text, for example by removing a PDF.</p>

    <p>For details on bidi markup, please see Section 8.2 of HTML [<a
href="#HTML4.0-8.2">HMTL 4.0-8.2</a>]. The text of HTML 4.0 gives this
      recommendation: </p>
      <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Using HTML directionality markup with Unicode
        characters.</strong> Authors and designers of authoring software should be
        aware that conflicts can arise if the <a
  href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#adef-dir"
  class="noxref"><samp class="ainst">dir</samp></a> attribute is used on
        inline elements (including <a
  href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#edef-BDO"
  class="noxref"><samp class="einst">BDO</samp></a>) concurrently with the
        corresponding <a href="#Unicode"
  class="normref">[UNICODE]</a> formatting characters. Preferably one or the
        other should be used exclusively. The markup method offers a better
        guarantee of document structural integrity and alleviates some problems
        when editing bidirectional HTML text with a simple text editor, but some
        software may be more apt at using the <a href="#Unicode"
  class="normref">[UNICODE]</a> characters. If both methods are used, great
        care should be exercised to insure proper nesting of markup and directional
        embedding or override, otherwise, rendering results are undefined.</p>
        </blockquote>
    <p>This document goes beyond HTML and recommends that <em>only</em> the markup
      should be used.</p>
      <p class="note"> The interpretation of how to handle directionality markup
        for block level elements differs in different versions of [<a
  href="#CSS">CSS</a>].</p>
    <p><em>What to do if detected</em>: In a browser context, ignore. When
      received in an editing context, replace the characters by the appropriate
      markup. </p>

  <section id="Deprecated">
    <h3>Deprecated Formatting Characters, U+206A..U+206F</h3>
    <p><em>Short description</em>: These characters are deprecated. They were
      originally intended to allow explicit activation of contextual shaping,
      numeric digit rendering and symmetric swapping.</p>
    <p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters were retained from draft
      versions of ISO 10646.</p>
    <p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: The processing model for these
      characters is not supported in markup.</p>
    <p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The Unicode Standard requires that
      symmetric swapping, contextual shaping, and alternate digit shapes are
      enabled by default and no longer supports inhibiting any of them by use of
      these character codes. The most likely effect of their occurrence in
      generated text would be that of a 'garbage' character.</p>
    <p><em>Conversion for use with markup</em>: Apply the appropriate conversion
      to bring the data stream in line with the Unicode text model for
      bidirectional text and cursively-connected scripts.</p>
    <p><em>What to do if detected</em>: When received by a browser as part of
      marked up text, they may be ignored. When received in an editing context,
      they may be removed, possibly with a warning. Alternatively, an appropriate
      conversion from the legacy text model may be provided. This will most likely
      be limited to applications directly interfacing with and knowledgeable of the
      particular legacy implementation that inspired these characters.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="BOM">
    <h3>Byte Order Mark, ZWNBSP, U+FEFF</h3>
    <p><em>Short description</em>: U+FEFF has two functions. It is formally known
      as <span class="uname">zero width no-break space</span> (ZWNBSP), and can act as a word joiner, but its primary use is as <em>byte
      order mark (BOM)</em>, to indicate in a file signature at the start of a file
      that a file is in a particular Unicode encoding form and of a particular byte
      order. Using U+FEFF as a word joiner in new data is deprecated  as of [<a
href="#Unicode32">Unicode3.2</a>] in favor of U+2060 <span
class="uname">word joiner</span> (WJ). The use as byte
      order mark remains unaffected.</p>
    <p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Originally included in Unicode for the sole
      purpose of indicating byte order or use in file signatures, the character
      acquired the ZWNBSP semantics as part of the merger between ISO/IEC 10646 and
      Unicode. When used as a byte order mark the character is placed at the
      beginning of a file. If a recipient views it as FEFF then the byte order
      between sender and receiver match. If the recipient views it as FFFE (a
      non-character code point) then the sender used opposite byte order from the
      recipient, and the recipient needs to invert the byte order or refuse to read
      the file. When used as a ZWNBSP the character is intended to prevent breaks
      between adjacent characters. This function is now provided by U+2060 <span
class="uname">word joiner</span> (WJ) making it
      unnecessary to insert U+FEFF in the middle of a file. For more information
      see Chapter 16 of [<a href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
    <p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Using U+FEFF as ZWNBSP makes it
      impossible to distinguish it from the case where a byte order mark was left
      in the middle of a file inadvertently due to incorrect splicing. U+FEFF can
      and in some cases (XML encoded in UTF-16) must be used at the start of a file
      containing markup, but as a signature, this is not part of actual markup or
      marked-up content. Some older versions of browsers and parsers may not
      correctly recognize U+FEFF at the start of a file encoded in UTF-8. For
      details of how U+FEFF participates in encoding detection of XML files, see
      Appendix F of <a href="#xml10">[XML 1.0]</a>. </p>
    <p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The use of byte order mark as ZWNBSP is
      also problematic when used in plain text, and has been deprecated for that
      purpose in favor of U+2060 <span class="uname">word
      joiner</span>. The use of U+FEFF in file signatures to indicate byte order is
      the only recommended use of this character.</p>
    <p><em>Replacement markup</em>: None. In locations other than the beginning
      of a text file, U+FEFF can be removed or replaced by U+2060 in an editing
      environment.</p>
    <p><em>What to do if detected</em>:  When received by a browser as part of
      marked-up text, treat depending on location. At the start of an external
      entity, treat as byte order mark (i.e. as part of the character encoding, not
      as part of the parsed character stream, see e.g. Section 4.3.3 of <a
href="#xml10">[XML 1.0]</a>). Otherwise, assume it is older data using it as
      ZWNBSP. When receiving plain text in an editing environment, editors may take
      one or more of several actions: replace ZWNBSP in the middle of a file with
      WJ or issue a warning to the user.</p>

  <section id="Interlinear">
    <h3>Interlinear Annotation Characters, U+FFF9-U+FFFB</h3>
    <p><em>Short description</em>: The interlinear annotation characters are used
      to delimit interlinear annotations in certain circumstances. They are
      intended to provide text anchors and delimiters for interlinear annotation
      for in-process use and are not intended for interchange.</p>
    <p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The interlinear annotation characters were
      included in Unicode only in order to reserve code points for very frequent
      application-internal use. The interlinear annotation characters are used to
      delimit interlinear annotations in contexts where other delimiters are not
      available, and where non-textual means exist to carry formatting information.
      Many text-processing applications store the text and the associated markup
      (or in some cases styling information) of a document in separate structures.
      The actual text is kept in a single linear structure; additional information
      is kept separately with pointers to the appropriate text positions. This is
      called out-of-band information. The overall implementation makes sure that
      these two structures are kept in sync. If the text contains interlinear
      annotations, it is extremely helpful for implementations to have delimiters
      in the text itself; even though delimiters are not otherwise used for style
      markup. With this method, and unlike the case of the object replacement
      character, all textual information can remain in the standard text stream,
      but any additional formatting information is kept separately. In addition,
      the Interlinear Annotation Anchor serves as a placeholder for formatting
      information for the whole annotation object, the same way a paragraph mark
      can be a placeholder to attach paragraph formatting information.</p>
    <p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including interlinear annotation
      characters in marked-up text does not work because the additional formatting
      information (how to position the annotation,...) is not available.</p>
    <p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The interlinear annotation characters
      are also problematic when used in plain text, and are not intended for that
      purpose. In particular, on older display systems that simply ignore or
      replace the Interlinear Annotation Characters, the meaning of the text may be
      changed.</p>
    <p><em>Replacement markup</em>: The markup to be used in place of the
      Interlinear Annotation Characters depends on the formatting and nature of the
      interlinear annotation in question. For ruby, please see [<a
href="#Ruby">Ruby</a>].</p>
    <p><em>What to do if detected</em>:  When received by a browser as part of
      marked-up text, they may be ignored. When receiving plain text in an editing
      environment, editors may take one or more of several actions: remove U+FFF9
      together with removing all characters between U+FFFA and following U+FFFB; 
      ignore U+FFF9 and turn U+FFFA and U+FFFB  into "[" and "]" respectively, or
      into similar characters; issue a warning to the user; or tentatively convert
      into appropriate ruby markup for further editing and formatting by the
      user.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="Object">
    <h3>Object Replacement Character, U+FFFC</h3>
    <p><em>Short description</em>: The object replacement character is used to
      stand in place of an object (e.g. an image) included in a text.</p>
    <p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: The object replacement character was
      included in Unicode only in order to reserve a codepoint for a very frequent
      application-internal use. Many text-processing applications store the text
      and the associated markup (or in some cases styling information) of a
      document in separate structures. The actual text is kept in a single linear
      structure; additional information is kept separately with pointers to the
      appropriate text positions. The overall implementation makes sure that these
      two structures are kept in sync. If the text contains objects such as images,
      it is extremely helpful for implementations to have a sentinel in the text
      itself; any additional information is kept separately.</p>
    <p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Including an object replacement
      character in markup text does not work because the additional information
      (what object to include,...) is not available.</p>
    <p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The object replacement character is
      also problematic when used in plain text, because there is no way in plain
      text to provide the actual object information or a reference to it.</p>
    <p><em>Replacement markup</em>: The markup to be used in place of the Object
      Replacement Character depends on the object in question and the markup
      context it is used in. Typical cases are &lt;xhtml:img src='...' /&gt;,
      &lt;xhtml:object ...&gt;, or &lt;html:applet ...&gt;. These constructs allow
      providing all additional information needed to identify and use the object in
      question.</p>
    <p><em>What to do if detected</em>: Browsers may ignore this character. When
      received in an editing context, if the actual object is accessible, editors
      may either replace the character by the appropriate markup for that object,
      or otherwise remove it, ideally providing a warning.</p>

  <section id="Musical">
    <h3>Musical Controls, U+1D173..U+1D17A</h3>
    <p><em>Short description</em>: A series of characters for controlling scope
      in musical notation.</p>
    <p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters designate the start and
      end of common musical constructs. Full musical layout depends on additional
      information, for example pitch, that cannot be encoded using Unicode.
      However, many musical symbols may be depicted in isolation (and without
      assigning pitch) as part of a textual discussion of music. Plain text use of
      Unicode characters is primarily intended for this latter purpose. The scoping
      operators can be used to support limited renderings of beams, slurs, phrases,
      etc. in this context. However, in the context of markup languages, musical
      scoring calls for a dedicated markup language (analogous to MathML) which
      would be expected to contain markup for these constructs.</p>
    <p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters duplicate
      information that can in principle be expressed in markup.</p>
    <p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: Their special code range allows them to
      be easily filtered, but applications that do not expect them will treat them
      as garbage characters.</p>
    <p><em>Replacement markup</em>: Replace with equivalent markup if
      available.</p>
    <p><em>What to do if detected</em>: Browsers may ignore these characters.
      When received in an editing context, editors may remove or replace them by
      equivalent markup.</p>
  </section>
  
  <section id="Language">
    <h3>Language Tag Characters, U+E0000..U+E007F</h3>
    <p><em>Short description</em>: A series of characters for expressing language
      tags, based on existing standards for language tags using the rules in
      Chapter 16 of [<a href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
    <p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: These characters allow in-band language
      tagging in situations where full markup is not available, while allowing easy
      filtering by applications that do not support them. They were solely included
      for the benefit of those Internet protocols, such as ACAP, which require a
      standard mechanism for marking language in UTF-8 strings, and at the same
      time to avoid the use of other tagging schemes that relied on specific
      details of the encoding form used.</p>
    <p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters duplicate
      information that can be expressed in markup.</p>
    <p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: Their special code range allows them to
      be easily filtered, but applications that do not expect them will treat them
      as garbage characters.</p>
    <p><em>Replacement markup</em>: Replace with equivalent language markup. XML
      and XHTML have the xml:lang attribute. HTML has the lang attribute. These
      attributes follow different scoping rules than the tag characters, therefore
      this replacement will generally not be a simple 1:1 substitution.</p>
    <p><em>What to do if detected</em>: Browsers may ignore these characters.
      When received in an editing context, editors may remove or replace them by
      equivalent markup.</p>

  <section id="OtherDeprecated">
    <h3>Other Characters Deprecated in Unicode</h3>
    <p><em>Short description</em>: The Unicode Character Database [<a
href="#UnicodeData">UnicodeData</a>] lists all characters that have been
      deprecated in [<a href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>]. This list may grow (slowly)
      over time. Deprecated characters remain valid characters forever, but their
      use is strongly discouraged. Deprecation of characters is applied only in
      exceptional circumstances. It is never the result of historical changes of a
      writing system: characters no longer in current, modern use are retained in
      Unicode, as they are needed for the representation of historical
      documents.</p>
    <p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Usually, characters that are deprecated
      were never needed, but were inadvertently added to the Unicode Standard,
      perhaps based on incomplete information available at the time of encoding.</p>
    <p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Except where noted elsewhere in
      this document, their presence in markup presents the same problems as in
      plain text, usually that of an unnecessary duplicate encoding.</p>
    <p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: Depends on the character and the reason
      for its deprecation. For more information see [<a
href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
    <p><em>Conversion for use with markup</em>: For deprecated characters not
      discussed elsewhere in this document, see the relevant descriptions of those
      characters in [<a href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>] for information on the
      recommended alternatives.</p>
    <p><em>What to do if detected</em>:  Unless a specific recommendation is
      given elsewhere, deprecated characters are not ignored; where possible, in an
      editing environment, a preferred alternate encoding may be substituted.</p>

  <p>The following subsections briefly discuss some of the characters from the
    above list, particularly those that affect more than their immediately
    adjacent neighbors. Please see the Unicode Standard [<a
href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>] for full details.</p>
  <section id="Subtending">
    <h3>Subtending Marks</h3>
    <p>Subtending marks are needed to represent a common feature in the Arabic
      and Syriac scripts where a mark can be placed below a range of characters,
      for example below a sequence of digits, to indicate a year. The Syriac
      abbreviation mark is placed above a series of characters, making it
      technically a supertending mark, and the <span
class="uname">ARABIC END OF AYAH</span> is an enclosing
      mark. In the character stream, a subtending mark precedes the affected
      characters. The end of affected range of characters is defined implicitly,
      usually by the first non-alphanumeric character. </p>
    <p>Unlike subtending marks, the scope of combining enclosing
      marks, such as <span
style="text-transform: uppercase; font-variant: small-caps;">combining
      enclosing circle,</span> is limited to the preceding default grapheme
      cluster. For details on grapheme clusters see Unicode Standard Annex #29:
      "Text Boundaries", [<a href="#UAX29">UAX 29</a>] .</p>
    <p>There is currently no existing markup that can represent the
      scoping and layout functions defined by these characters, so they cannot be
      substituted. It is unresolved to what degree intervening markup affects the

  <section id="Fraction">
    <h3>Fraction Slash</h3>
    <p>The fraction slash is used between sequences of decimal
      digits to form fractions. Whether the resulting fraction has a horizontal or
      diagonal fraction line is unspecified. The fallback is to leave the digits
      unchanged and display a regular slash. In order to separate a digit from a
      following fraction, as in 1¾, the use of <span
class="uname">U+2009 THIN SPACE</span> is recommended.</p>
    <p>For better control of fractions the use of [<a
href="#MathML">MathML</a>] is suggested where appropriate.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="Variation">
    <h3>Variation Selectors</h3>
    <p>A variation selector is intended to cause a specific variant form (or
      range of variant forms) when applied to a base character. For a variation
      selector to have an effect it must immediately follow its base character.
      Only pre-determined combinations of selected base characters and specific
      variation selectors have a defined effect. All other combinations are
      ill-formed and are to be ignored. The list of standardized combinations is
      documented in the Unicode Character Database, see [<a
href="#Variants">Variants</a>]. In addition to the 256 generic variation
      selectors, there are 3 Mongolian <em>free variation selectors</em>. They
      function in all other ways like variation selectors, except they only apply
      to base characters from the Mongolian script. Since Mongolian, like Arabic,
      has positional character shapes, the variations are limited to particular
      shaping contexts.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="Ideographic">
    <h3>Ideographic Description Characters</h3>
    <p>Ideographic Description Characters are included in the Unicode Standard as
      a means to indicate the composition of ideographs from a combination of
      pieces (terms), where each piece or term is either a Unicode character or
      composed. Ordinarily the result would be a human readable description of a
      character, perhaps one for which a font is not available. However, at least
      some vendors are interested in automatic conversion of these sequences into
      single ideographs.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="Invisible">
    <h3>Invisible Mathematical Operators</h3>
    <p>These characters are needed to convey the intended meaning of a
      mathematical expression to an automated parser whenever two elements are
      simply written next to each other. See Unicode Technical Report #25: "Unicode
      Support for Mathematics" [<a href="#UTR25">UTR25</a>] for more details.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="LineBreak">
    <h3>Line Break Controls</h3>
    <p>Most of these characters prevent line breaks adjacent to them, but ZWSP
      and SHY provide invisible line break opportunities. The detailed function of
      these characters is described in Unicode Standard Annex #14: "Line Breaking
      Properties" [<a href="#UAX14">UAX14</a>]. While high-end applications may be
      able to deduce line breaking opportunities automatically solely with the help
      of very generic markup or styling properties, the use of these characters
      currently provides the most reliable and straight-forward way to control line
      breaking and hyphenation. Note that [<a href="#html4.01">HTML4.01</a>] uses
      U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE also as a "hard space" (i.e. a space with a fixed
      width), something that is not part of its character semantics in [<a
href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
    <p>U+2011 NON-BREAKING HYPHEN (NBHY) is used to encode a hyphen that does not
      provide a line break opportunity. In several languages, the sequence &lt;SHY,
      NBHY&gt; may be used to handle special line breaking behavior for explicit
      hyphens, see  [<a href="#UAX14">UAX14</a>].</p>
  </section>
  <section id="Fillers">
    <h3>Hangul Fillers</h3>
    <p>These should not be needed except for texts that need to have a fixed
      number of jamos per Korean syllable block. See the description of Korean
      Syllable Blocks in [<a href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>].</p>
  </section>
</section>
<section id="Compatibility">
  <h2>Characters with Compatibility Mappings</h2>
  <p>The Unicode Standard provides compatibility mappings for a number of
    characters. Compatibility mappings indicate a relationship to another
    character, but the exact nature of the relationship varies. In some cases the
    relationship means "is based on" in some other cases it denotes a property.
    When plain text is marked up, it may make sense to map some of these
    characters to a combination of their compatibility equivalents <em
style="font-style: normal;">and</em> suitable markup. It is important to
    understand the nature of the distinctions between characters and their
    compatibility equivalents and the context in which these distinctions matter.
    It is never advisable to apply compatibility mappings indiscriminately. This
    section provides guidance on when and how to apply compatibility mappings in
    the case of importing text from non-XML (non-marked-up) sources. The section
    is organized by the "compatibility tag" associated with each compatibility
    mapping.</p>
  <section id="Overview">
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>The following table gives an overview of the various compatibility
      characters, organized by "compatibility tag". The first column, Tag
      value, contains the value of the "compatibility tag" from the Unicode
      Character Database [<a href="#UnicodeData">UnicodeData</a>]. Although these
      tags use "&lt;" and "&gt;", they do not appear as such in markup and should
      not be confused with XML tags. <em>Code range</em> indicates a further break
      down by code points. Action summarizes the recommended action to be
      taken whenever markup is first applied to non-XML text. Each entry indicates
      whether the characters can be substituted using the compatibility equivalent
      according to Normalization Form KC of [<a href="#UTR15">UAX 15</a>], can be
      replaced by equivalent markup where available, or should be retained. For
      some cases, instead of or in addition to markup, style information [<a
href="#CSS">CSS</a>] is needed. Description and usage provides
      additional information. Sections <a href="#List">5.3</a> through <a
href="#Superscripts">5.6</a> provide additional information for some of these
      sets of compatibility characters including detailed recommended actions.</p>

  <section id="Generating">
    <h3>Generating New Text</h3>
    <p>Presentation forms and characters for which adequate representation exists
      as marked up text should never be entered into new data. Many of the
      characters with &lt;font&gt; tag are however suitable for new data, as long
      as they are used in the manner they are intended, that is as symbols, with
      definite semantic differentiation between the different forms. The largest
      set of these characters exists to carry essential semantic distinctions in
      mathematical notation, where the any loss of markup during text export would
      compromise the meaning of the text. Most of the characters with &lt;super&gt;
      and &lt;sub&gt; tag have been encoded for use in phonetic or phonemic
      transcriptions, where they act as ordinary letters and the use of style
      markup is therefore deemed inappropriate. However, it is inappropriate to use
      any of these classes of characters to create the appearance of styled text
      runs.</p>
    <p>For example to write <span style='font-style: italic;'>hello</span>
	  (in italic style), one should use the
	  equivalent of <code translate='no'>&lt;span style='font-style: italic;'&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;</code>,
      and not the sequence of Unicode characters ℎℯℓℓℴ
	  (<span class='uname'>U+210E PLANCK CONSTANT</span>,
	  <span class='uname'>U+212F SCRIPT SMALL E</span>,
	  <span class='uname'>U+2113 SCRIPT SMALL L</span>,
	  <span class='uname'>U+2113 SCRIPT SMALL L</span>,
	  <span class='uname'>U+2134 SCRIPT SMALL O</span>).
	  Conversely, to indicate <i>Planck's constant</i> one should use
      ℎ (<span class='uname'>U+210E PLANCK CONSTANT</span>) and not something such as
	  <code translate='no'>&lt;span style='font-style: italic;'&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;</code>.</p>
    <p>When style is applied across entire words, sentences or paragraphs, the
      use of markup is preferred. When style is applied to individual letters,
      especially to letters inside a word, giving them a particular interpretation,
      the use of character codes is preferred. See also <a
href="#Superscripts">Section 5.6</a>.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="List">
    <h3>List Item Marker Characters</h3>
    <p><em>Short description</em>: Characters with a &lt;circled&gt; tag or
      characters with &lt;compat&gt; tag and compatibility mapping to a
      parenthesized string.</p>
    <p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: They are most frequently used for marking
      enumerated list items, but the characters with a &lt;circled&gt; tag often
      occur as dingbats or footnote markers in tables. The same characters are used
      in regular text when citing an item from a corresponding ordered list.</p>
    <p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: These characters do not cause undue
      interaction with markup</p>
    <p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: None</p>
    <p><em>Replacement markup</em>: (in text use) these characters are often used
      in running text; sometimes, but not exclusively, in situations where the text
      is to be associated with an item from a nearby numbered list. Replacement
      markup may not be available, and the support for such markup is much more
      limited today than was anticipated when this document was first written.</p>
    <p>(list item style) When generating marked up text these characters occur
      only internal to the user agent when list item styles are rendered. When
      marking up plain text data they could be converted to suitable list item
      styles, if such use can be properly inferred. The default recommendation is
      to retain the original character.</p>
    <p>(characters with compatibility mappings of the form "(<em>n</em>)" or
      "<em>n</em>." or roman numerals) Unlike circled characters, these could be
      rendered by sequences of regular characters. Using a list item marker style
      would in theory allow the support of longer lists (the Unicode characters are
      limited to the set  (1) to (20) and "1." to "20."). Using regular character
      sequences would also allow the use of fonts that match the text of the
      list.</p>
    <p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action needs to be taken by browsers.
      When received in an editing context, substitution of a list item marker style
      may be appropriate. However, the same characters are very often used as
      dingbat-like symbols in tables, or may appear in general text, whether or not
      referring to an item from a list. Therefore the user must have the choice of
      whether to replace the character.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="Fractions">
    <h3>Fractions</h3>
    <p><em>Short description</em>: Single character fractions such as ½ or ¼.</p>
    <p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Subsets of these occur in practically all
      legacy character sets.</p>
    <p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: The character repertoire is limited
      to a few common fractions. When used with more general methods of generating
      fractions such as MathML [<a href="#MathML">MathML</a>] the usual problem of
      dual representation arises.</p>
    <p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: Other than normalization issues, these
      characters present no undue problems in plain text. Where fraction slash is
      supported, these can be expressed by substituting their compatibility
      mappings. </p>
    <p><em>Replacement markup</em>: MathML can represent fractions unambiguously.
      When using fraction slash, care must be taken such that values like 3½ do not
      turn into 31/2 (=15.5).</p>
    <p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action needs to be taken by browsers
      or editors, except when converting plain text to MathML.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="Squared">
    <h3>Squared or Horizontal</h3>
    <p><em>Short description</em>: Characters that are symbols composed of groups
      of typically kana or Latin letters, digits plus slash for use in a single
      display cell in vertical display of text. </p>
    <p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>: Many existing character sets contain these
      as precomposed characters since for simple implementations this is the only
      way to support the common use of providing metric units and other
      abbreviations in a single character cell for vertical text layout. </p>
    <p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Proposed markup, including CSS
      styling, would be able express an unbounded set of these abbreviations,
      obviating the need of cataloguing these in the character encoding standard
      and making them more directly accessible to text based processing, for
      example searching.</p>
    <p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: The repertoire of these legacy
      characters is limited; many more combinations are in actual use than are
      accounted for in character sets. Pre-composed symbols do not make their text
      content available to search engines. They also require re-encoding for text
      laid out horizontally.</p>
    <p><em>Replacement markup</em>: None available.</p>
    <p><em>What to do if detected</em>: No action required. (Subject to change
      pending the outcome of current proposals.)</p>
  </section>
  <section id="Superscripts">
    <h3>Superscripts and Subscripts</h3>
    <p><em>Short description</em>: Mainly super and subscript digits, but also
      signs, parentheses and a large number of letters.</p>
    <p><em>Reason for inclusion</em>:  Super and subscripted letters and digits
      are quite common in some forms of phonetic or phonemic transcriptions, where
      the use of styles is both awkward and prone to data integrity issues when
      exported to plain text. For super or subscripted letters in phonetic
      transcription in particular, a change from superscript of subscript to
      regular style would alter the meaning. Note that such use in transcription is
      not limited to letters: superscripted small digits are often used to indicate
      tone. When used for these purposes, these characters should be retained and
      markup should <em>not</em> be used. </p>
    <p>A few super and subscript characters, primarily the digits, also occur in
      many legacy character sets, including Latin-1. Their use in pure plain text
      is common for databases, e.g. including metric units for part descriptions 
      (viz. cm<sup>2</sup>) or for (usually simplified) formulae as occur in titles
      of scientific publications. </p>
    <p>When used in mathematical context (MathML) it is recommended to
      consistently use style markup for superscripts and subscripts. This is
      because mathematical layout allows not just individual symbols, but entire
      expressions to be superscripted or subscripted in a regular, nested
      manner.</p>
    <p><em>Problems when used in markup</em>: Mixing direct use of these
      characters with the use of style markup provides multiple representations of
      the same text, leading to potentially different treatment by search and
      display engines.</p>
    <p>However, when super and sub-scripts are to reflect semantic distinctions,
      it is easier to work with these meanings encoded in text rather than markup,
      for example, in phonetic or phonemic transcription. Otherwise, they would
      require markup in the middle of words, and  they may also be inadvertently
      changed to normal style text, when exporting to plain text. This applies to
      the majority of super and subscripted characters in Unicode.  On the other
      hand, some user agent may support certain superscripted or subscripted
      characters only when used as marked up text for example, because of lack of
      font support for them.</p>
    <p><em>Problems with other uses</em>: none</p>
    <p><em>Replacement markup</em>: Unless used as letters, &lt;xhtml:sup&gt; and
      &lt;xhtml:sub&gt; or &lt;mathml:msup&gt; and &lt;mathml:msub&gt; may be
      used.</p>
    <p><em>What to do if detected</em>: Both representations (with or without
      style markup) should be equivalent for search purposes. Input methods for
      mathematical texts might enforce the use of styles.  If superscript
      characters are encountered during display of mathematical formulae, it is
      recommended that they be displayed in a manner indistinguishable from that
      achieved by using regular characters with corresponding style markup.. </p>

  <h2>Noncharacters</h2>
  <p>The Unicode Standard defines 66 non-character code points, or <span class="qterm">noncharacters</span>. These are the last two positions on each of the 17
    planes, in other words, all characters whose code points end in ...FFFE or
    ...FFFF, as well as the 32 code points from U+FDD0 to U+FDEF. Applications
    are free to use any of these code points internally but should never attempt
    to interchange them. In effect, noncharacters can be thought of as
    application-internal private-use code points.</p>
</section>
<section id="White">
  <h2>White Space</h2>
  <p>This section presents common issues with white space characters in markup
    languages, mostly based on their difference in function as part of the
    structure of the markup source (syntactic white space) on the one hand and as
    part of the document content on the other hand.</p>
  <p>The set of characters in the Unicode standard that have the property
    "White_Space" (see 'White Space' in the [<a href="#UnicodeData">UCD</a>]) is
    quite large. It includes white space characters with different line breaking
    properties, different ligating properties, and different widths. It is
    appropriate to use these characters as part of markup content for their very
    specific purpose. It  is preferable to place them in the markup source so
    that they are surrounded by ordinary characters rather than line breaks for
    example.  The set of white space characters defined by typical markup
    language specifications is a subset of the characters that are considered
    white space by [<a href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>] .</p>
  <p>Each markup language defines the set of characters that it accepts as part
    of the markup syntax, this is usually a very small set. The XML [<a
href="#xml10">XML1.0</a>] and [<a href="#xml11">XML1.1</a>] specifications
    define white space as a combination of one or more of the following
    characters: U+0020 SPACE, carriage return (U+000D), line feed (U+000A), or
    tab (U+0009). [<a href="#html4.01">HTML4.01</a>] adds to these the form feed
    character (U+000C), but that character cannot be used in any XHTML
    version.</p>
  <p>In addition, markup languages may use conventions for converting or
    removing some kinds of white space. XML processors replace some combinations
    of end-of-line characters by a single line feed character. [<a
href="#xml10">XML1.0</a>] normalizes any two character sequences of (U+000D
    U+000A) or any U+000D not followed by U+000A to a single U+000A. [<a
href="#xml11">XML1.1</a>] also normalizes NEL (U+0085) and U+2028 LINE
    SEPARATOR, but U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR is not treated that way. Additional
    processing of white space before it is handled to an application also occurs
    for attribute values: line breaks are replaced by spaces, leading and
    trailing spaces are removed, and subsequent spaces are replaced by a single
    space.</p>
  <p>In XML, white space is purely syntactic inside tags, for example, to
    separate the element name from attributes, and between elements in element
    content models (as they are typical for data-oriented applications). White
    space in element content models is used to lay out the markup source, using
    line breaks and indentation, to improve readability. The same use of white
    space is possible in many cases in mixed content (typical for text-oriented
    applications).</p>
  <p>Because XML is used for a very wide range of applications, after the
    processing steps mentioned above it passes all white space to the
    application. Some XML applications such as [<a href="#XHTML">XHTML</a>] may
    have their own white space processing rules when processing white space
    characters. Also, applications and software transforming XML (e.g. [<a
href="#XSLT">XSLT</a>]) have specific conventions of how they handle white
    space, and specific ways of how to control this behavior. To appropriately
    use white space characters, readers are advised to examine all involved
    standards and software.</p>
  <p>If the characters U+2028 and U+2029 appear in text, they may be treated as
    zero-width characters without semantic meaning (see Section 3.2).</p>
  <section id="converting-nl-to-ws">
    <h3>Converting Newline Functions to White Space</h3>
    <p>White space that is not purely syntactic, including control codes that
      define a newline function (see Section 5.8, Newline Guidelines, in [<a
href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>]), can be handled in three main ways.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>For data-oriented applications, the textual content of elements is
        treated according to the needs of the data type in question. In many
        cases, processing by the application includes aspects similar to those of
        the processing of attribute values by the XML parser itself. For some
        types of data, in particular small data items, some applications may also
        simply prohibit the use of white space.</li>
      <li>For running text in text-oriented applications, reflowing is used, i.e.
        the line breaks in the markup source are removed and the text is reflown
        into lines whose length is determined by the output medium and styling
        properties. In the context of Unicode, this reflowing process requires
        care; it is described in more detail below.</li>
      <li>For preformatted text, such as program source code, line breaks must be
        preserved. Text-oriented applications usually contain special markup for
        preformatted text, e.g. &lt;xhtml:pre&gt;. XML itself defines an
        xml:space attribute that applications may use for a similar purpose.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When reflowing, line breaks and adjacent white space can be treated as
      space, removed, collapsed with adjacent control characters of the same type,
      or treated as zero-width space. Which choice is appropriate depends on the
      script of the surrounding text. The assumption is that line breaks and
      adjacent white space (in particular following white space, used for
      indentation) was added to make the markup source more readable, in particular
      to make each line fit on a line of a plain text editor. For scripts that use
      spaces, line breaks will have been inserted where there originally was a
      space; treating them as spaces therefore preserves the intended separation
      between words. For scripts which do not use spaces, such as Ideographic
      scripts or certain South East Asian scripts, such as Thai, line feeds should
      be removed, or replaced by U+200B zero width space. The choice of treatment
      can depend on the script value of the characters preceding and following the
      line feed character, assuming these characters belong to the same run of
      text.</p>
      <p class="note"> The Unicode Standard [<a href="#Unicode">Unicode</a>]
        specifies that the zero width space is considered a valid line-break point
        and that if two characters with a zero width space in between are placed on
        the same line they are placed with no space between them; and that if they
        are placed on two lines no additional glyph area is created at the
        line-break.</p>
    <p>The details of reflowing are the responsibility of the various markup
      applications (e.g. [<a href="#XHTML">XHTML</a>]). However, there is a
      tendency to move this functionality from markup applications to styling, so
      that it can be shared across applications.</p>
    <p>Authors should be aware of the fact that the above script-specific
      treatment of line breaks when reflowing text is not yet available in all
      implementations (e.g. browsers). For scripts that do not use white space to
      separate words, it may therefore still be advisable to not split long
      lines.</p>
    <p>Editing tools should try to support the user in the appropriate use of
      white space. Some white space characters cannot easily be entered via a
      keyboard, but some others, e.g. U+3000 Ideographic Space, can. Editing tools
      should try to make sure that only line breaks and white space that is
      accepted as syntactic white space by the relevant markup language are used to
      improve markup source readability.</p>
    <p>While the styling possibilities provided by CSS and its implementations
      have not reached the level of professional typesetting systems, they offer a
      wide range of ways to control layout and spacing of text. A very simple
      example is text centering, which would have been done by inserting an
      appropriate number of spaces on each line in pure plain text.</p>
